INTRODUCTION                                    *netrw-cfg-split-explorer*

Sets the netrw global variable options to the only values I think make sense.

COMMANDS                                        *netrw-cfg-split-explorer-commands*

None. Sets a few `g:*` netrw configuration values.

- Hide the banner. Press <I> to toggle it.
>
  let g:netrw_banner = 0
<
- Open files in the current window pane.
  This is a split explorer after all, and not a project drawer!
>
  " Options:
  "  1 - open files in a new horizontal split
  "  2 - open files in a new vertical split
  "  3 - open files in a new tab
  "  4 - open in previous window
  "  0 - re-use same window (default)
  let g:netrw_browse_split = 0
<
- Show a 'thin' directory listing. Because bug in 'tree' view cannot open
  symlinks; the 'long' view is a mess because tab stops do not align; and
  the 'wide' view generally requires extra keystrokes to find and open files.
>
  " Options: 'thin', one-file-per-line (0); long (1); wide (2); and tree (3).
  let g:netrw_liststyle = 0
